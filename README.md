# SR_Online_task

The experiment file is called PRL_reliability.html. This is where the experiment code is held.

The img folder holds the images.

The extra_js folder contains some extra javascript functions that can be called.

The jsPsych folder contains all the jsPsych code and plugins including the custom plugin that we wrote for displaying the two images in the reversal learning task.

Please make changes in forked branches.

If anything is confusing or broken, then create an issue and assign it to Brendan or Lily (or whoever is appropriate for addressing the issue).
